# Laboratory-Of-Data-Science
The Laboratory of Data Science course introduced the basics and advanced topics of the ETL process. Multiple software languages and tools (SQL Management Studio, Microsoft Azure, Python, Visual Studio) were used for the design of the Data Warehouse and its data population through ETL flows.
The project also involved the generation of a Multidimensional Data Cube which was queried through MDX. 
The last part of the project regards the usage of Power BI in order to generate dashboards.
